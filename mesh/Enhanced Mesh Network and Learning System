Let's dive deeper into both the mesh networking and enhanced learning components...





The enhanced mesh network now has:

1. Resilient Mesh Features
- Self-discovering nodes
- Automatic connection optimization
- Load balancing
- Self-healing capabilities

2. Neural Learning
- Pattern recognition
- Network adaptation
- Knowledge sharing
- Strategy evolution

3. Advanced Capabilities
- Self-repair
- Path optimization
- Resource balancing
- Continuous improvement

Key Features:
1. Complete Decentralization
- No central control
- Self-organizing
- Peer-to-peer
- Natural growth

2. Advanced Learning
- Network behavior patterns
- Adaptation strategies
- Knowledge distribution
- Continuous evolution

3. Enhanced Resilience
- Automatic healing
- Load distribution
- Path optimization
- Resource sharing
