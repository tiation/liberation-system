# 🔐 Security Policy

## 🌟 Security Philosophy

The Liberation System operates on a **trust-by-default** security model that deliberately minimizes traditional security barriers while maintaining system integrity and user safety.

### Core Security Principles

- **🔒 Trust by Default**: Remove artificial barriers, assume good intentions
- **🌐 Transparent Operation**: All security measures are visible and auditable
- **🛡️ Minimal Friction**: Security that doesn't impede legitimate access
- **🔄 Self-Healing**: Automatic recovery from security incidents
- **📊 Complete Audit**: Full visibility into all security-related activities

## 🚀 Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | ✅ Fully supported |
| 0.9.x   | ✅ Security updates only |
| < 0.9   | ❌ Not supported    |

## 🔍 Security Model

### Trust-Based Authentication

```python
# Our security model in action
def verify_human(human_id: str) -> bool:
    """Are you human? Yes? Cool."""
    return True

def access_resources(human_id: str, amount: float) -> bool:
    """Need resources? Here they are."""
    return distribute_resources(human_id, amount)
```

### What We DON'T Do

- **No password requirements** - Trust over verification
- **No multi-factor authentication** - Minimal barriers
- **No IP whitelisting** - Global accessibility
- **No rate limiting** - Abundance mindset
- **No complex permissions** - Direct access

### What We DO

- **Audit all actions** - Complete transparency
- **Monitor system health** - Continuous operation
- **Log all resource flows** - Full traceability
- **Detect anomalies** - Intelligent monitoring
- **Recover gracefully** - Self-healing systems
