- **Features**:
  - Trust by default philosophy
  - No authentication requirements
  - Maximum accessibility
  - Anti-security approach

### 5. **Configuration System** (`core/config.py`)
- **Functionality**: Centralized configuration management
- **Features**:
  - Environment variable support
  - JSON configuration files
  - Dark neon theme settings
  - Modular component configs

### 6. **Core Integration System** (`core/liberation_core.py`)
- **Functionality**: Main orchestration system
- **Features**:
  - Task scheduling and prioritization
  - System health monitoring
  - Error handling and resilience
  - Graceful shutdown capabilities
  - Real-time status dashboard

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### Dark Neon Theme
- **Colors**: Cyan (#00ffff), Magenta (#ff00ff), Yellow (#ffff00)
- **Background**: Black (#000000) with dark surfaces
- **Typography**: Monospace fonts for terminal aesthetic
- **Styling**: Neon glows and gradient effects

### Enterprise-Grade Features
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging system
- **Error Handling**: Robust exception management
- **Monitoring**: Real-time system health checks
- **Persistence**: Database storage for all data
- **Scalability**: Async architecture for high performance

### Trust-Based Philosophy
- **No Verification**: Resources flow without bureaucracy
- **Maximum Access**: Remove artificial barriers
- **Direct Action**: No waiting, no applications
- **Transparency**: Open operation, no hidden processes
