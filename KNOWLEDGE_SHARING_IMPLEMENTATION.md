## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components

```
Knowledge Sharing System
├── KnowledgeShareManager     # Main orchestrator
├── KnowledgeEntry           # Individual knowledge items
├── LearningSession          # Collaborative sessions
├── ProblemContext           # Problem-solving contexts
└── AI Enhancement           # Autonomous optimization
```

### Database Schema

```sql
-- Knowledge entries with full metadata
knowledge_entries (
    id, title, content, knowledge_type, status, author,
    tags, created_at, updated_at, version, parent_id,
    confidence_score, usage_count, effectiveness_rating,
    related_entries
)

-- Collaborative learning sessions
learning_sessions (
    id, title, description, participants, knowledge_entries,
    created_at, status, insights_generated, problems_solved
)

-- Problem contexts for autonomous solving
problem_contexts (
    id, problem_description, domain, priority, created_at,
    attempted_solutions, status, confidence_level
)

-- AI learning patterns
learning_patterns (
    id, pattern_type, pattern_data, created_at, updated_at
)
```

## 🔧 Integration Points

### Liberation Core System
```python
# Integrated into core/liberation_core.py
self.knowledge_system = KnowledgeShareManager()
await self.knowledge_system.initialize()

# Added to task scheduler
await self.add_task("share_knowledge", self.share_knowledge, priority=3)
```

### API Integration
```python
# Added to api/app.py
knowledge_system = KnowledgeShareManager()
await knowledge_system.initialize()

# REST endpoints for external access
@app.get("/api/v1/knowledge")
@app.post("/api/v1/knowledge/add")
@app.get("/api/v1/knowledge/search")
```
